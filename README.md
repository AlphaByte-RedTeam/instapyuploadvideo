# Automate video upload to Instagram

The story behind this repo is, I was elected as a vice leader in one of the class in my college. I was given the responsibility to upload the videos of the class to Instagram. I was using my phone to upload the videos. But it was a tedious task to upload the videos one by one. So I decided to automate the process.

# Steps to run the script

1. Clone the repo by running `git clone https://github.com/instapyuploadvideo/`
2. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or your favorite notebook
4. Run all the scripts
5. Wait until all the progress are completed
